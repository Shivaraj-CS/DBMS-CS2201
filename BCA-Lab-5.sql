(102, 3, 'Mobile', '2024-02-20'),

(104, NULL, 'Desktop', '2024-04-01'),   -- Order without customer (to test outer joins)
(105, 1, 'Keyboard', '2024-05-05');

---------------------------------------------------
-- 1. INNER JOIN Queries
---------------------------------------------------

-- a) Find all orders placed by customers from the city "Bangalore."
SELECT c.customer_name, o.product_name, o.order_date
FROM Customers c
INNER JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE c.city = 'Bangalore';

-- b) List all customers with the products they ordered.
SELECT c.customer_name, o.product_name
FROM Customers c
INNER JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

-- c) Show customer names and their order dates.
SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_date
FROM Customers c
INNER JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

-- d) Display order IDs with the corresponding customer names.
SELECT o.order_id, c.customer_name
FROM Orders o
INNER JOIN Customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;

-- e) Find the number of orders placed by each customer.
SELECT c.customer_name, COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id;

-- f) Show city names along with the products ordered by customers.
SELECT c.city, o.product_name
FROM Customers c
INNER JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

---------------------------------------------------
-- 2. LEFT OUTER JOIN Queries
---------------------------------------------------

-- a) Find all customers and their orders, even if a customer has no orders.
SELECT c.customer_name, o.product_name
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

-- b) List all customers and the products they ordered.
-- (Same as above, including NULL for customers without orders)

-- c) Show customer IDs, names, and their order IDs.
SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name, o.order_id
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

-- d) Find the total number of orders (if any) placed by each customer.
SELECT c.customer_name, COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id;

-- e) Retrieve customers who have not placed any orders.
SELECT c.customer_name
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_id IS NULL;

-- f) Display customer names with their order dates.
SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_date
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

---------------------------------------------------
-- 3. RIGHT OUTER JOIN Queries
---------------------------------------------------

-- a) Find all orders and their corresponding customers, even if an order doesn't have a customer.
SELECT o.order_id, c.customer_name, o.product_name
FROM Orders o
RIGHT JOIN Customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;

-- b) Show all orders with the customer names.
-- This is same as above.

-- c) Display product names with the customers who ordered them.
SELECT o.product_name, c.customer_name
FROM Orders o
RIGHT JOIN Customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;

-- d) List order IDs with customer cities.
SELECT o.order_id, c.city
FROM Orders o
RIGHT JOIN Customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;

-- e) Find the number of orders per customer (include those without orders).
-- Same as LEFT JOIN from customer perspective, RIGHT JOIN here will be less useful.

SELECT c.customer_name, COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders
FROM Orders o
RIGHT JOIN Customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id;

-- f) Retrieve customers who do not have any matching orders.
SELECT c.customer_name
FROM Orders o
RIGHT JOIN Customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE o.order_id IS NULL;

---------------------------------------------------
-- 4. FULL OUTER JOIN Queries
---------------------------------------------------

-- Note: MySQL does not support FULL OUTER JOIN directly.
-- Workaround with UNION of LEFT and RIGHT JOINs excluding duplicates.

-- a) Find all customers and their orders, including those with no orders and orders without customers.
SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name, o.order_id, o.product_name
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
UNION
SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name, o.order_id, o.product_name
FROM Customers c
RIGHT JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

-- b) List all customers and products, whether they placed an order or not.
-- Same as above.

-- c) Show customer IDs with order IDs (include unmatched ones).
-- Same as above.

-- d) Display customer names with order dates.
-- Same as above but show order_date instead of product_name

SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_date
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
UNION
SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_date
FROM Customers c
RIGHT JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

-- e) Find all unmatched records (customers without orders and orders without customers).
SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name, o.order_id, o.product_name
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_id IS NULL

UNION

SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name, o.order_id, o.product_name
FROM Customers c
RIGHT JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE c.customer_id IS NULL;

-- f) Show customer cities with products.
SELECT c.city, o.product_name
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
UNION
SELECT c.city, o.product_name
FROM Customers c
RIGHT JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

---------------------------------------------------
-- 5. NATURAL JOIN Queries
---------------------------------------------------

-- a) Find all orders placed by customers.
SELECT *
FROM Customers NATURAL JOIN Orders;

-- b) List all customers with the products they ordered using NATURAL JOIN.
SELECT customer_name, product_name
FROM Customers NATURAL JOIN Orders;

-- c) Show customer names along with their order dates using NATURAL JOIN.
SELECT customer_name, order_date
FROM Customers NATURAL JOIN Orders;

-- d) Find all customer cities and the products ordered by those customers using NATURAL JOIN.
SELECT city, product_name
FROM Customers NATURAL JOIN Orders;
